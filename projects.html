					Slender Fortress Modified
				</p>

				<p>
					Slender Fortress is a custom gamemode made in 2013 that takes the concept of Slender: The Eight Pages and puts it in Team Fortress 2. Originally developed by Kit o' Rifty, picked up by Kenzzer in 2014, and picked up by me in 2018 as a different branch, hence the rebranding. The goal is simple, collect all collectibles within a specific time limit, escape to a specific point once all collectibles are collected, and avoid any enemies in a stealth like way.

					Slender Fortress Config Rewriter
				</p>

				<p>
					Due to updating Slender Fortress and the gamemode's creation side focusing more on refined configs, either server owners and creators could manually rewrite all of their NPC configs or do it automatically, this tool automatically rewrites the configs to be up to date using either a simple console based window or an upcoming basic UI which is more refined.
